# ShinyPowerBI

Shiny apps can be enriched with embedded dashboards. In this document the necessary steps to embed a Power BI dashboard are highlighted.

Using the Power BI Javascript API, you can embed Power BI reports in an R Shiny web application. The reports are fully interactive, can be in edit or readonly mode, and additional functionalities are available (filters, bookmarks, ...).

This is supporting content from the RStudio Conf 2022 talk "Building a shiny client portal for a mortgage management group with embedded Power BI reports" by Thomas Wouters and Joran De Wilde. Find all the conference material on <https://www.rstudio.com/conference/>.
